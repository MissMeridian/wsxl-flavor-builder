**A simple and easy-to-use flavor manager for the WeatherSTAR XL, complete with DIF exporting for ease of installing custom flavors. Compatible with Windows, Linux, and probably Mac.**

With the Flavor Builder, you can:
- Create local forecast flavors
- Extract, load, and save flavors directly from the WeatherSTAR DIF
- Save/load flavors to your computer to modify at any time
- Export flavors in DIF format for easy import
- Customize product and sensor order
- Add flavor modifiers

## Setup
First, make sure you install the [requirements](https://github.com/MissMeridian/wsxl-flavor-builder/blob/main/requirements.txt).
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run [FlavorBuilderGUI.py](https://github.com/MissMeridian/wsxl-flavor-builder/blob/main/FlavorBuilderGUI.py) with Python to get started.

## Using the Flavor Builder
### Flavor Management 
- **Reset Flavor**
  - Resets the active flavor configuration back to a blank state.
- **Load Flavor from JSON**
  - Load a previously saved flavor JSON file. Defaults to the "flavor-data" folder.
- **Save Flavor to JSON**
  - Save the active flavor configuration to a JSON file. Defaults to the "flavor-data" folder.
- **Load Flavors from DIF**
  - Extracts all flavors from a WeatherSTAR DIF file (either .txt or .dat) and opens a [new window](https://github.com/MissMeridian/wsxl-flavor-builder/blob/main/.github/dialog_extract.png) where you can:
    - Load a single selected flavor into the Flavor Builder for editing
    - Save selected flavor(s) to your computer as JSON files
    - Save all discovered flavors to your computer as JSON files
- **Export Flavor to DIF**
  - Outputs your flavor configuration as an importable .txt file for the WeatherSTAR XL.
### Flavor Editing
- **Flavor Name**
  - The callable name of the flavor as used by PelOrion. Must only be uppercase alphanumerical characters.
- **Init Flavor**
  - **Checkbox:** Determines whether the flavor name will be initialized as callable by PelOrion.
  - **Modifiers field:** Optionally appends the flavor name modifier string to the Init value.
    - The modifier string can be used to append additional letters to the flavor name when called under certain conditions.
- **Clock Enabled**
  - If checked, the clock element will be added to the misc layer for the entirety of the forecast length.
- **Products & Sensors**
  - Add a product/sensor by name, and set the duration for it to display.
  - You can the name and duration of existing products/sensors with the same menu.

## Support and Feedback

## To-Do
- Add product/sensor definitions to product-data and sensor-data as parseable JSON. (Could include human names for each product/sensor, and whether the product is an intro, or has an associated intro)
- "Add intro" checkbox when adding applicable products
- Multi-flavor DIF exports
